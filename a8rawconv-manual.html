        </p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <i>a8rawconv</i> is a utility for converting between raw and decoded disk images,
            taking advantage of recent availability of high-quality devices for reading and
            writing raw flux-level images of floppy disks. This allows for easy and fast
            methods of creating usable images of floppy disks without a modified disk drive,
            particularly unusually encoded or even copy protected floppy disks. Decoded disk
            images are better suited for testing in an emulator or on real hardware using
            a disk simulator, and provide a way to verify whether a disk image is valid before
            archiving.
        </p>
        <h2>Basic usage</h2>
        <h3>Running the program (Windows)</h3>
        <p>
            The converter is provided in binary form as a Win32 command line utility called
            <tt>a8rawconv.exe</tt>, which can be run on Windows 7 or later, on either
            a 32-bit or 64-bit system. To use it, open a Command Prompt and run the program
            from the command line. This allows command-line arguments to be specified and
            the output to be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Source code is also provided so that the converter can be rebuilt or modified.
            Visual Studio 2022 or newer is required.
        </p>
        <h3>Running the program (Linux or macOS)</h3>
        <p>
            Although binaries are not provided for other platforms, the source code is included
            so that it can be compiled. The core is designed to be portable to most systems that have at
            least a C++11 compiler, with the serial device functionality also available
            for Linux systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            To compile the converter, build <tt>compileall.cpp</tt> with a C++ compiler
            in C++11 or C++14 mode. This file is a bulk file that includes all the other
            files, avoiding the need for a build system. This is the same build process
            used for the Release build on Windows. Typically, this will suffice (replace
            with your preferred C++ build system as appropriate):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>g++ -O2 -std=c++14 compileall.cpp</tt>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Command-line syntax</h3>
        <p>
            <i>a8rawconv</i> is a command-line program that is invoked with the following
            syntax:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv <i>[options]</i> <i>source-image</i> <i>destination-image</i></tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Basic operations just take two filenames, the path to the source file and the
            path to the destination file. The specific operation, such as decoding, encoding,
            or format conversion, is determined by the filename extensions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many options are also supported to tweak the operation of the program. The list
            of options is documented within the program itself, which can be seen simply
            by running the program with no arguments:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv</tt>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Decoding raw disk images</h3>
        <p>
            The main use of <i>a8rawconv</i> is to convert from a raw disk image produced
            by imaging hardware to a more usable decoded disk image. This can be done by
            running <i>a8rawconv</i> with the input and output names:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv track00.0.raw mydisk.atx</tt><br/>
            <tt>a8rawconv mydisk.scp mydisk.atx</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Raw images can be produced from physical floppy disks either by KryoFlux or
            SuperCard Pro imaging hardware. By default, the input format, decoding parameters and output format
            are determined by the extension on the input and output filenames; <tt>.atx</tt> selects
            the VAPI/ATX format with Atari 8-bit decoding parameters. Similarly, <tt>.nib</tt>
            selects the NIB disk format with Apple II 5.25" decoding parameters. These
            can be overridden with the <tt>-if</tt>, <tt>-of</tt>, and <tt>-d</tt> parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            When using KryoFlux raw streams (track00.0.raw, track02.0.raw, etc.), a 96/135 tracks per inch (TPI)
            drive and an 70/80 track dump are assumed by default. Thus, the converter will dump
            even tracks. When using a 48 TPI drive and 35/40 track dumps, the <tt>-tpi</tt>
            switch must be used to change the interpretation to 48 TPI.
        </p>
        <p>
            Side 2 of a KryoFlux double-sided raw stream set can be decoded as a single-sided disk
            by specifying <tt>track00.1.raw</tt> as the starting filename. (This will only work if the
            disk drive has been adjusted, since normally the top and bottom heads are offset.)
        </p>

        <h3>Interoperability problem with SuperCard Pro images</h3>
        <p>
            The SuperCard Pro (.scp) format has some issues with ambiguity in the way that tracks
            are stored in the file, which can make it difficult to reliably determine whether
            the tracks are stored with physical 48tpi or 96tpi spacing. This can cause interoperability
            problems between programs where one program cannot read <tt>.scp</tt> images written
            by another program. Current versions of <i>a8rawconv</i> use heuristics to try to
            interpret the file, but incompatibilities may still occur, particularly depending
            on the value of the disk type ID in the SCP image header.
        </p>
        <p>
            To combat this problem, the <tt>-if</tt> and <tt>-of</tt> switches can be used to force
            a particular interpretation of the track list. All four combinations of single-sided,
            double-sided, 40-track (48tpi), and 80-track (96tpi) are supported. For instance, if
            the other program is expecting the track list to be emitted with two sides and 40-track
            spacing, the <tt>scp-ds40</tt> format ID will cause <i>a8rawconv</i> to read and write
            the <tt>.scp</tt> file with this layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Atari disks specifically, <i>a8rawconv</i> follows the actual behavior of the official
            SuperCard Pro software up through version 2.20, which is to write images with
            the Atari 400/800 disk type ID with a track layout of 40 tracks of two sides each in
            the first 80 entries of the track list. This
            means that for a single sided image, only every other track entry is populated or used.
            This is regardless of whether the image header specifies 48tpi or 96tpi, as that flag
            indicates the properties of the drive used and not the image layout.
        </p>

        <h2>Imaging physical floppy disks</h2>
        <p>
            Typically, the first step is to create a raw image of a floppy disk using the software
            that comes with the imaging hardware. There are a few things that should be kept in
            mind when doing this:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use the preservation modes of the imaging software when possible. This
                typically records five revolutions of all tracks on the disk. For older
                disk formats this often over-images the disk, but that's much better than
                finding out later you're missing part of it. Another reason to do this
                is that if the physical disk is deteriorating, you only want to do one
                pass on the disk because you may not get another chance. The safest approach
                is simply to grab a full five revolutions of all 80 tracks on both sides
                and sort it out later.
            </li>
            <li>
                For Atari 8-bit disks, you <i>must</i> have at least two revolutions imaged
                per track, and you must image 40 tracks. An index-aligned, one-rev image
                will not work because sectors can cross the index mark. A single revolution
                in splice mode also will not work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Atari 8-bit disks have 40 tracks. Recording with a straight C64 or Apple II
                profile won't work, because you'll only have 35 out of the 40 tracks.
            </li>
            <li>
                More revolutions are better because <i>a8rawconv</i> can use the duplicate
                data to salvage marginal sectors or distinguish stable from weak sectors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Currently, <i>a8rawconv</i> expects 80 track images when reading KryoFlux raw
                streams by default. 40-track (48 TPI) image sets can be used by supplying the
                <tt>-tpi 48</tt> switch when decoding.
            </li>
            <li>
                While Atari drives spin at 288 RPM, and the PC drives used for imaging
                spin at either 300 RPM or 360 RPM, either speed is fine for imaging. The
                converter detects the speed of the imaging drive from the raw image and
                adjusts the decoding parameters for the difference in speed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <i>a8rawconv</i> supports both KryoFlux raw streams (*.raw) and SuperCard Pro images
            (*.scp). Although there are differences between both the KryoFlux and SuperCard Pro
            hardware and software, both produce images suitable for conversion and neither has
            a significant advantage over the other in image quality or read reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
            When archiving, it is always recommended that you keep the original raw images of
            a disk for archival purposes even if the converter successfully creates a fully
            functional decoded disk. This is because the decoded disk does not contain all of
            the information of the original disk. If it turns out that something is missing or
            the converter is updated, the raw source can be used to reconvert without using
            the physical disk again. Raw images compress well using standard compression tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            In non-archival cases, this can be skipped. If you are decoding a disk
            containing a BASIC program you wrote as a kid, there won't be any copy protection
            on the disk and it's unlikely you'll care about the exact sector timing.
            Therefore, once you verify that the decoded disk is good, you don't need to
            keep the raw image. The raw images are so small in modern terms, though, that you
            might consider still keeping them around.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Some versions of the SuperCard Pro software have a buggy profile for
            Atari 8-bit disks and will attempt to create an image using a single index-aligned
            revolution. This will result in lost sectors on most disks due to sectors being
            split across the index mark and <i>a8rawconv</i>
            will issue a warning if it sees this in the image. The imaging parameters must be
            manually adjusted to at least two revolutions.
        </p>
        <h3>Reading directly from physical floppy disks</h3>
        <p>
            <i>a8rawconv</i> can also use a SuperCard Pro device to directly read from
            a floppy disk. The SuperCard Pro software must be installed first to install
            the USB communications driver, after which the converter can access the hardware
            using special filenames:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>(Windows):</li>

            Therefore, a physical disk can be imaged as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv scp0:96tpi test.scp</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            On Windows, <i>a8rawconv</i> will automatically search for the first COM port that is
            a USB connection to a SuperCard Pro device, specifically an FTDI-based USB serial port
            driver identified as VID_0403+PID_6015+SCP-JIMA. The Virtual COM Port (VCP) mode of the FTDI
            serial driver must be enabled for this to work. It can be enabled in Device Manager.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Linux, the serial device name must be
            manually specified, and you may also need to run with elevated (superuser) privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reading directly from a floppy disk can be useful when doing testing or transferring
            data. It is not recommended for old floppy disks since a raw image is not created during
            the process, and repeating the decoding process with different settings requires re-reading
            the disk, which is slower and puts more stress on the disk. Archiving should always be done
            by creating a preservation-level raw image once and then re-decoding the raw image as
            necessary.
        </p>

        <h3>Imaging to flux</h3>
        <p>
            When imaging from a physical disk, the destination can either be a raw flux image
            (e.g. <tt>disk.scp</tt>) or a decoded image type (e.g. <tt>disk.atx</tt>). The best
            target depends on the disk. In most cases, it is best to image directly to a raw flux
            image first:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv scp0:96tpi disk.scp</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This will by default record a full five revolutions of each track in the image, in one
            pass on the disk. The image can be then be decoded multiple times from that image
            without requiring another pass on the original disk. More importantly, it can be
            <i>re-decoded</i> later again if something is discovered problematic with an earlier
            decode. Taking a preservation-level image of the disk in this manner is the safest
            way to deal with rare disks that may be starting to fail.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a couple of other switches that can be useful when doing a raw image. One
            is the <tt>-revs</tt> switch, which sets the revolution count when reading from an
            SCP device. The range is 1-5 revs, though 2 revs are minimum for non-index aligned
            disks like Atari disks. Reducing the rev count with <tt>-revs 2</tt> is useful for
            faster imaging of a non-critical disk in good condition, and will also produce a
            smaller <tt>.scp</tt> image.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other useful switch is <tt>-g</tt>, which overrides the disk geometry. a8rawconv
            will normally determine the best geometry based on the input and output formats, but
            for a raw imaging operation there is no such information. In this case, it will
            assume single-sided 40 tracks, which is enough to image up to Atari double-density
            but may be inadequate for other formats. <tt>-g</tt> allows the track and side
            count to be overridden, such as <tt>-g 80,2</tt> for double-sided 80 tracks. This
            also allows overdumping up to 42 or 84 tracks for disks that have extra information
            outside of the normal track range. For truly blind cases where the disk format is
            totally unknown, it can be a good idea to just dump a full 83 tracks on both sides --
            the unused tracks can just be ignored later if they turn out to not have any data.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Imaging to a decoded image</h3>
        <p>
            On the other hand, sometimes a disk isn't that precious and the two step process isn't
            convenient. For instance, if you just wrote out a disk from a 1050 and just want to
            image it, you can go directly from the physical disk to decoded image:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv scp0:96tpi disk.atx</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            In this case, <i>a8rawconv</i> will both read and decode the disk in one pass. Of course,
            if something is wrong and the decoding parameters need to be adjusted, the disk will
            also need to be read again.
        </p>

        <h3>Assessing the quality of an image</h3>
        <p>
            The converter has a few features to assess the quality of a decoded image. The
            simplest is just how many sectors were extracted. For Atari 8-bit single density
            disks &mdash; the most common format &mdash; the converter should report no missing
            sectors or sectors with errors:
        </p>
        <pre>Writing ATX file: e:\test.atx
0 missing sectors, 0 phantom sectors, 0 sectors with errors</pre>
        <p>
            On the other hand, you might see something like this:
        </p>
        <pre>Writing ATX file: e:\test.atx
WARNING: Track 20, sector 16: Multiple sectors found at the same position
         0.81 but different bad data. Encoding weak sector at offset 25.
WARNING: Track 20: Missing sectors: 18.
1 missing sector, 0 phantom sectors, 1 sector with errors</pre>
        <p>
            If your disk is supposed to be just a normal DOS disk, this means you have some
            problems. If it's a commercial release, and especially if it is copy protected,
            then this might be expected. In the latter case, some experience with copy
            protection techniques is helpful and testing the decoded disk image is recommended.
        </p>

        <h3>Tweaking the decoding period</h3>
        <p>
            <i>a8rawconv</i> is designed to have good defaults so that most of the time
            conversion can be performed without a string of command-line switches. However,
            sometimes tweaking is necessary. One useful switch is the <tt>-p</tt> switch,
            which tweaks the default bit cell period used by the decoder, as a percentage of
            the normal value. This can be used
            to shrink or stretch the expected length of a bit slightly to nudge the decoder
            toward success when it is having trouble with a marginal disk:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv -p 98 disk.scp disk.atx</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The recommended approach is to try small adjustments in the range of 95-105 and
            watch the number of errors to zero in on the best value. Don't try crazy values
            like 70 or 130 to start with; you're likely to just get complete failure to
            decode the track. Watch out for when the decoder starts missing sectors entirely,
            as past that point the error count may drop because the decoder stops seeing
            some of the sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <tt>-t</tt> switch is also useful when tweaking decoding settings. It limits
            decoding to a single track on the disk, filtering out errors from tracks other
            than the one you're focusing on:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv -t 27 disk.scp disk.atx</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Note that this also causes only that track to be emitted into the output file, so
            this should not be used to produce the final disk image file. When reading from
            a SuperCard Pro, this will seek the mechanism to and read only the selected track.
        </p>

        <h3>Post-compensation</h3>
        <p>
            Floppy disk media is subject to a <i>peak shift</i> effect where flux transitions
            that are close together can have their read signals interact such that the pulses read
            farther apart than they were originally written. This effect can be serious enough to
            push flux transitions out of their original bit cell timing. For 4us FM and GCR formats,
            this is typically ignored, but for 2us MFM formats this is usually handled on the
            write side with <i>write precompensation</i>, where patterns known to cause this
            problem are pre-adjusted to combat the peak shift effect and read with approximately
            intended timing.
        </p>
        <p>
            A notable exception to this is Macintosh 800K disks, which can show severe peak shift
            effects when read with a standard, constant-speed drive. This is partly due to the
            high flux density, with the 2us GCR format producing minimum transition spacing
            35% tighter than a 2us MFM format. To combat this, <i>a8rawconv</i> by default applies
            <i>post-compensation</i> on the flux pattern when decoding to or analyzing for
            the Macintosh GCR encoding format. This moves the transitions back closer to each
            other so they are sufficiently within bitcell timing. Currently post-compensation
            is not used for any other encoding as they are assumed to either not need it or to
            have already had write precompensation applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            If for some reason this default behavior is unsuitable, the post-compensation mode can
            be overridden with the <tt>-P</tt> switch.
        </p>

        <h3>Weak sectors</h3>
        <p>
            When multiple revolutions are available for a track, <i>a8rawconv</i> compares
            all copies of each physical sector to see whether they are the same. If they
            are not, it attempts to separate them into good and bad copies, and reports
            when this occurs:
        </p>
        <pre>WARNING: Track 38, sector  1: 1/3 bad sector reads discarded at position 0.25.</pre>
        <p>
            For a standard unprotected disk, this is a bad sign, as it means that the disk or either the
            imaging hardware is marginal, and could mean that either the disk is going bad
            or the imaging drive needs to be cleaned. Fortunately, the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
            stored with each sector allows the converter to tell if a sector is good, and this
            message means that the converter was able to recover the sector. This is one reason
            that five disk revolutions is recommended &mdash; the extra images of each sector increase
            the changes that the converter will be able to recover sectors from marginal disks.
        </p>
        <p>
            When tweaking the decoder timing with <tt>-p</tt>, the ratio of good to bad sector
            reads can be used to aid in determining whether a change in timing is helping or hurting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that in this case, "good" means that the sector was read correctly. Protected
            disks often have sectors that were written with deliberate CRC errors such that they
            are always read by the disk drive with errors; the converter can isolate good reads
            of these sectors in the same way, as both the CRC and data will be stable even if
            the CRC is incorrect.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event that the converter can't find at least two reads of the same sector that
            match, it will salvage as much common data as it can and then encode a <i>weak sector</i>:
        </p>
        <pre>WARNING: Track 38, sector  4: Multiple sectors found at the same position
         0.65 but different bad data. Encoding weak sector at offset 44.</pre>
        <p>
            For a regular disk, this is a bad sign as it means that the converter was not able
            to get a clean read of the sector. For protected disks, though, this can be valid
            as some disks were deliberately created with weak sectors that changed every time
            they were read by the disk drive. Typically there are only a small handful of these
            at most. When weak sectors are found, it is recommended
            that the decode be retried with different <tt>-p</tt> settings to try to determine
            whether these are truly weak sectors or bad reads of a stable sector.
        </p>
        <h3>Viewing track/sector layout</h3>
        <p>
            The <tt>-l</tt> switch causes the converter to display a crude representation
            of the sectors within each track. This is useful to identify unusual disk
            layouts:

            The left columns indicate the track number and number of physical sectors.
            The remainder of the line shows all sectors in the track, where the relative
            position of each sector number indicates the angular position of that sector.
            Remember that floppy disk tracks are a continuous circle, so the start and
            end of the line are the same position on the disk.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a disk formatted on a standard Atari 810 or 1050 drive, even and odd
            sectors will be separated due to <i>sector interleave</i>, a reordering
            of the sectors to improve read/write performance. Disk drives with high-speed
            capability can format with a different sector interleave for better high-speed
            performance. Some commercial disks were written with a non-standard interleave
            and read slower than usual on a real drive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sectors on successive tracks will also be offset due to skew between the tracks.
            This is related to the delay when stepping between tracks during initial formatting.
            It is also possible for tracks to lack such skew and be aligned to the index
            mark:

            Such a disk will read and write fine, but generally indicates
            that the disk was not created in an Atari drive. This example also shows
            a different sector interleave, which can cause the Atari to read the disk
            more slowly than usual.
        </p>
        <p>
            Highly unusual patterns typically indicate copy protection, such as this
            track with 34 physical sectors:

        <pre> 2 (34) | 2  34  56 7 8 9 10112 114 116 11  23  45  67  89 10111213115 117 1</pre>
        <p>
            Any track on a single-density Atari disk with more than 18 physical sectors
            on it has more than one duplicated or <i>phantom</i> sectors, where two
            or more physical sectors have the same sector number. This is used for
            protection schemes where the timing of the sector read determines which
            of the phantom sectors is read. Such a disk cannot be created on a stock
            Atari drive, although it can be created with a modified drive or with
            a hardware imager such as SuperCard Pro.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, there is the possibility that the disk is just simply something else:

            For Atari disk formats, the converter attempts both FM and MFM decoding on
            each track, which means that it can pick up even non-Atari disk formats.
            In this case, the disk has 9 index-aligned sectors per track with 512 bytes per track
            instead of 18 sectors per track of 128 bytes each, meaning that it is
            likely a 360K MS-DOS disk, not an Atari disk.

        <h3>Flippy disks</h3>
        <p>
            Some software shipped on "flippy" disks that could be flipped upside down to
            access another program variant or more data on the other side of the disk.
            Imaging these disks is problematic for a couple of reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Physically flipping the disk moves the index hole of the disk to the other
                side. The old floppy disk drives used with computers such as the Atari 800
                and Apple II were often configured such that the index hole was ignored.
                PC drives, however, can require the index hole to read the disk, and may
                simply refuse to read a flipped disk.
            </li>
            <li>
                Track 0 on side 1 (bottom) is at the equivalent position for track -4 on
                side 2 (top). This means that the flip side cannot simply be imaged in a
                double-sided drive, as the first four tracks will be inaccessible.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is possible to modify a floppy disk drive to circumvent one of these two problems.
            If the drive is modified to realign the second head, reading the disk image will
            produce track streams that are backwards. In that case,
            the <tt>-r</tt> option should be passed to <i>a8rawconv</i> so that it reads the
            track images backwards to match.
        </p>
        <h3>Multi-format disks</h3>
        <p>
            Ingenious fellows in the past found ways to create floppy disks that booted on
            more than one computer, by creatively interleaving sectors from the different
            formats on the same disk. <i>a8rawconv</i> does not directly support mixed-format
            disks, but can aid in detecting such disks and extracting out platform-specific
            versions. Unusual sector sizes or missing sectors/tracks in the layout map,
            particularly on tracks 1 or 18, are a possible sign of such a disk. In that
            case, conversion can be attempted using output formats for all platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is highly recommended that preservation-quality images of such multi-format
            disks be kept, as they are uncommon and currently can't be converted to a single
            decoded image.
        </p>

        <h3>Bit-level diagnosis</h3>
        <p>
            For experts dealing with troublesome disks, the <tt>-v</tt> option causes the
            converter to report additional information about the decoding process. There are
            four levels of verbosity:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <tt>-v</tt>: Reports summary information about all physical sector images found in
                all revolutions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <tt>-vv</tt>: Reports more detailed information on each sector.
            </li>

                    Listed on the left is the complete dump of the shift register states, and
                    on the right is the number of bit cell times measured for each group of
                    16 bits, composed of 8 clock bits and 8 data bits interleaved together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the relationship between clock and data bits and the byte alignment
                    is not known until a sync byte is found, the bit-level dump simply shows all
                    possible offsets. The layout of 16 shifts per line ensures that once the
                    sync byte is found, successive bytes will be in a column. Above, highlighted
                    in red, is the Data Address Mark (DAM) with $C7 clock pattern and $FB data byte,
                    followed by the first four data bytes of the sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that while byte alignment will always be consistent within a single address
                    field or data field, there is no requirement for the address and data fields
                    of a sector to share common byte alignment and the two will often be
                    skewed by some bit offset from each other.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <tt>-vvvv</tt>: Reports flux-level decoding output.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The higher verbosity levels can produce very large amounts of output, so restricting
            decoding to a single track with <tt>-t</tt> is highly recommended.
        </p>

        <h3>Flux analysis mode</h3>
        <p>
            Invoking <i>a8rawconv</i> with the <tt>-analyze</tt> switch selects flux analysis mode
            instead of regular conversion mode. In this mode, the flux timing of a raw disk is
            analyzed to show the distribution of flux timing and to give insight into either
            problems with the raw disk or if the wrong decoder is being used. <tt>-analyze</tt>
            takes one argument, the encoding mode to model to select appropriate bit cell timing.
            No output filename is needed with <tt>-analyze</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When <tt>-analyze</tt> is used, a histogram is produced for each track (<tt>-t</tt> is
            recommended to show one track at a time):

        <p>
            On a disk in good condition and without anomalies like bad sectors, the
            histogram peaks should be cleanly separated and centered around the expected
            timings for the encoding. In this case, this track uses Macintosh GCR
            encoding, which has a 2us bitcell and a maximum run of two consecutive 0 bits
            between 1 bits, so the expected timings are 2/4/6 us. As can be seen in the
            above, however, there is poor separation between 2us and 4us regions, which
            will make it hard for the decoder to distinguish <tt>11</tt> and <tt>101</tt>
            patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            The above histogram was generated with post-compensation disabled. With the
            default <tt>mac800k</tt> post-compensation mode enabled, the result is
            better:

        <p>
            The analyzer will work with any flux pattern regardless of the specified
            encoding, but the encoding is used to calibrate the time scale. For instance,
            using <tt>pc-360k</tt> will scale the time axis and use labels for a 2us
            bit cell at 300 RPM. The analysis encoding setting will also determine the
            default post-compensation mode unless overridden with the <tt>-P</tt> switch.
        </p>

        <h3>False successes</h3>
        <p>
            It is possible for the converter to believe it has successfully read
            a sector when it hasn't. The CRC16 used by the Atari disk format and other 177x compatible
            disk formats makes this unlikely. Unfortunately, 5.25" Apple II disks use a weak 8-bit XOR
            checksum algorithm that is more prone to false negatives and can fail to
            detect errors. This has been seen in practice with old disks that had many
            marginal sectors when read.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only truly reliable way to verify a disk is to examine it manually, either by
            attempting to boot the decoded image or checking the files. The latter case can be
            annoying as the Apple II standard for text has the high bit set. The <tt>-I</tt> switch
            will invert bit 7 on decoded data so that text files can be more easily read in
            a hex editor. The resulting image will not work in an Apple II environment, however.
        </p>

        <h2>Converting between image formats</h2>

        <h3>Downconverting to a simpler format</h3>
        <p>
            <i>a8rawconv</i> can also convert between decoded disk image formats. In this case,
            flux-level processing is skipped and the decoded sectors are converted directly.
            One use for this is to 'deprotect' an ATX file to ATR, when the disk image has no
            protection and does not need full timing data:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv test.atx test.atr</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This will only work if the ATX disk image is compatible with the ATR format, with
            sectors of uniform size and no unusual sector encodings. Timing information is
            dropped, any missing sectors are padded, and special sector information like
            CRC errors or weak bits are discarded. Warnings are displayed when this occurs
            to indicate that the image may not work, especially for copy protected images.
            However, this can also occur with unprotected, marginal disks that simply had
            bad sectors, and this may be fine if those sectors are not needed.
        </p>

        <h3>Upconverting to a more complex format</h3>
        <p>
            It is also possible to go the other way, by converting from ATR to ATX:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv test.atr test.atx</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            In this case, <i>a8rawconv</i> will synthesize timing data for the disk image.
            This can be useful to enforce a specific sector interleave order, which can't
            be encoded in ATR but can in ATX. By default, the ATX image has sectors laid
            out with the sector interleave and track-to-track skew typical for an Atari
            1050 disk drive. This can be overridden with the <tt>-i</tt> switch, as
            described in <a href="#overriding-the-default-interleave">Overriding the
            default interleave</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Converting between flux formats</h3>
        <p>
            A KryoFlux (<tt>.raw</tt>) image can be converted to SuperCard Pro format (<tt>.scp</tt>):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv track00.0.raw image.scp</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            For this conversion, partial revolutions at the beginning and end of each track
            image are dropped, and the flux timing samples are converted from KryoFlux 40ns
            precision to SuperCard Pro 25ns precision. No sector analysis is performed, however,
            and the flux samples are converted without interpreting them, so this is agnostic
            to disk format and will work with non-Atari formats.
        </p>

        <h3>Reincarnating an image</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, the most unusual but occasionally useful conversion mode is from a file
            format to the same file format:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv test.atx test2.atx</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            In this case, <i>a8rawconv</i> will rewrite the disk image with the same contents
            but a new structure. This is useful if data is intact in the file but there is
            some issue with the structure that is causing compability problems with other
            software; if <i>a8rawconv</i> can read the file, it can re-write it with a clean
            structure. This includes fixing issues from older versions of <i>a8rawconv</i>.
        </p>

        <h2>Writing images to physical disks</h2>
        <h3>Encoding and writing a pre-decoded image</h3>
        <p>
            With a SuperCard Pro device, <i>a8rawconv</i> can also write images back to
            physical disks. This is not typically useful for distribution as no one distributes
            software on physical floppy disks anymore, but can still be useful for testing or
            if floppy disk is the only way to get software onto a real computer. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To do so, simply specify the SuperCard Pro as the output device instead of
            the source:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv test.atr scp0:96tpi</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The converter will then encode the disk image to physical format and write them
            to the physical disk through the SCP. Pre-erasing or preformatting the disk
            is not necessary. Both Atari FM (single) and MFM (enhanced) formats can
            be encoded and written back to disk. Note that on an 80 track (96 TPI) drive,
            only the even tracks are written.
        </p>
        <p>
            <tt>135tpi</tt> can also be specified as a synonym for <tt>96tpi</tt>, as 3.5"
            drives are also 80 tracks but have 135 TPI track density.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also possible, though not recommended, to write out an <tt>.scp</tt>
            image instead:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv test.atx test.scp</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The reason this isn't recommended is that the <tt>.scp</tt> format always includes
            tracks from index-to-index and does not include
            information about appropriate splice points for the image. <i>a8rawconv</i>
            can deal with this because it has knowledge of the Atari disk format and will
            re-analyze the image and choose a splice point between sectors for ending the
            track write, but other tools may not and may tear a sector overlapping the
            index mark. In particular, using the stock SuperCard Pro software to write
            the image will likely fail and write a broken track unless the tracks are all
            index-aligned.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The image written back to disk will not be the same as the original,
            even though it will have the same sector data content.
            This is because the converter re-lays out the track according to the standard
            format expected by Atari disk drives, which can cause small timing differences
            from the original. If an accurate duplicate is required, it should be produced
            from the raw stream image using the duplication software supplied with the hardware.
        </p>
        
        <h3><a name="overriding-the-default-interleave">Overriding the default interleave</a></h3>
        <p>
            Older computer systems could not read sectors at full speed from the disk drive and
            required the sectors to be <i>interleaved</i> for optimum ordering for the speed
            at which they could read the disk. Using the wrong interleave results in slow
            disk reads because the disk drive has to wait longer for each sector to arrive
            under the drive head when the computer requests it. On Atari disks, this typically
            results in sectors being read from the disk at about half the normal speed.
        </p>
        <p>
            In <i>a8rawconv</i>, interleaving is usually handled automatically. When decoding
            a disk from a raw flux/nibble format or a format with timing information like ATX,
            the sector order and thus interleave pattern is already present. The case that matters
            is when converting from a format that doesn't have sector timing information, like
            ATR, to a raw format or a format with timing information. In that case, <i>a8rawconv</i>
            will apply a sector interleave appropriate for Atari disk geometry. The defaults are
            a 9:1 interleave for single density and double density, and a 13:1 interleave for
            enhanced density. This provides normal read speed on 1050 and XF551 disk drives
            with standard 19,200 baud communication. For 512 byte sectors, such as expected
            for PC and Amiga disks, a 1:1 interleave is applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some cases, the default interleave may need to be overridden with the <tt>-i</tt> switch.
            This includes if a foreign disk format is being used that doesn't match the
            heuristics or if a disk needs to be re-interleaved for high-speed operation.
            For example, <tt>-i xf551-hs</tt> will cause a 9:1 interleave to be used for
            double-density disks for XF551 high-speed operation. Similarly, Indus GT CP/M disks
            need 1:1 interleave and should be written with <tt>-i none</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <tt>-i</tt> option also affects track skew, the difference in timing between
            the start of one track and the next track. By default, a track skew of 8% of a rotation
            is applied unless 1:1 interleaving is being used, in which case no skew is applied
            and all tracks are index-aligned. For Atari disks without copy protection, track skew
            is not critical and only affects a minor delay when stepping between tracks -- all
            Atari-compatible disk drives must be able to read non-aligned tracks. Some
            non-Atari formats are naturally index aligned, however, and should not be encoded
            with track skew.
        </p>

        <h3>Problems during encoding</h3>
        <p>
            Plain disk images with standard geometry typically write out to a physical disk
            without problems. For protected disks, the converter has support for writing
            sectors with CRC errors, long sectors, phantom sectors, deleted sectors, and
            even weak sectors, and can write out usable versions of many protected disks.
            However, some types of encoding can still pose a problem for the encoder.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main problem that can occur when writing out a protected disk is long tracks:
        </p>
        <pre>WARNING: Track 2, sectors 4 and 2 overlapped during encoding. Encoded track may not work.</pre>
        <p>
            This happens when there are phantom sectors on the track, and more sectors than can
            fit onto the track with standard encoding. When this happens, the <tt>-p</tt> option
            can be used to record bits onto the track at a faster rate, squeezing more data onto
            the track. This should be done with care as it reduces the read margin and can cause
            the disk to read unreliably or not at all. Also, as with decoding, small increments
            should be used when adjusting the period, around 95-105; starting with <tt>-p 50</tt> will simply produce an
            unusable disk.
        </p>
        <p>
            When writing long sectors with CRC errors, <i>a8rawconv</i> will write the sectors
            with their intended length but truncate the sectors at 128 bytes. This saves space
            on the track, but produces the same result as the standard disk interface only reports
            the first 128 bytes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Occasionally, a disk image may have a track with an impossibly high number of sectors
            in it, such as 36 sectors per track, that can't be written out in usable form even
            with tight <tt>-p</tt> settings. This almost always means that the track was crafted to
            have <i>overlapping</i> sectors, where the data field of one sector overlaps the address
            field and even the data field of the next sector. This is possible because the floppy
            drive controller (FDC) does not validate the clock bits of data bytes. Unfortunately,
            decoded image formats do not store where sectors were overlapped, and <i>a8rawconv</i>
            does not currently have analysis algorithms to encode overlapping sectors.
        </p>

        <h3>Writing flux images</h3>
        <p>
            <i>a8rawconv</i> can also write raw flux images to disk, both from KryoFlux and SuperCard Pro
            images. This is done using the same syntax as for writing a decoded image:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <tt>a8rawconv image.scp scp0:96tpi</tt>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            When writing a flux image, <i>a8rawconv</i> will first run a decoding pass as usual to
            identify and parse sectors from the image. However, those sectors are only used to identify
            the best points for starting each track write; the decoded sector is discarded and the
            original flux is then written to disk. This ensures that the splice point where the track
            write starts and where a few bits will be corrupted is safely between sectors where it will
            not affect reading the disk.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order for this to work, the source image has to contain at least two full revolutions
            of flux for each track image, so that the analyzer can identify start and stop points that
            don't split a sector. This almost always requires a splice point other than at the index
            mark and thus in the middle of a revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only one revolution's worth of flux is extracted and written to disk; any additional
            redundant flux data is ignored. Thus, writing raw flux from a marginal image is not advisable
            as the selected range may have bad sector reads. This will go unnoticed when writing from
            flux as the sector decoder is skipped. For a marginal image, it is better to
            decode the flux to data first so that <i>a8rawconv</i> can check the sector CRCs and
            try to find the a good image for each sector, and then reassemble the good sector copies
            into a clean track.
        </p>

        <h2>Supported formats</h2>
        <h3>Disk geometries</h3>
        <p>
            The main disk geometries supported by a8rawconv are listed below. In current versions,
            the disk geometry can also be varied with the <tt>-g</tt> switch, which is particularly
            useful when doing blind imaging of an unknown disk format. It takes two arguments, the
            track count and side count, so <tt>-g 80,2</tt> uses an 80-track double-sided geometry
            instead.

                Atari 8-bit decoded disk image. Widely supported by emulators, disk simulators, and
                disk image tools; supports all common disk geometries. This is the image format of
                choice for standard, unprotected Atari 8-bit disks and is the one that should be
                used by default. However, this disk format will
                not work for protected disks, as it has no place for timing, error, or duplicate
                sector metadata.

            <dt>ATX (read/write)</dt>
            <dd>
                Atari 8-bit extended decoded disk image. Known also by the name VAPI, the API originally
                published for software that established this format. Contains timing and error
                information and can encode most anomalies used in common copy protections. This
                format contains enough information to typically run the software, but only
                sometimes enough to recreate a working physical disk. Only 90K single density
                and 130K enhanced density disk geometries are supported. Software support is mediocre;
                all current emulators support it, but only some disk simulators
                and image tools do, and older tools or emulators do not. Notably, the older but still
                very popular Atari800WinPLus 4.0 emulator does not support ATX (there is a modified
                version, but it has some bugs).
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Enhanced density ATX images are supported by <i>a8rawconv</i> but are not universally

                is headerless and is simply a direct dump of all sectors in logical sector order.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                In most cases, ATR is a better choice than XFD. There is one exception: XFD is the
                only common format that can store a full 256 bytes from boot sectors on a double

                a low-level format and can accommodate some protection encodings, but is a partially
                decoded format as it captures data after the Disk II controller has done byte syncing.

        <h2>DiskScript</h2>
        <p>
            A <tt>.diskscript</tt> file allows generation of specific flux patterns through a readable
            text file that can then be processed like any other raw flux image, typically for writing
            to a physical disk. It is designed to simplify writing patterns that are accepted by
            the FDC for regular sector read/write commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use a DiskScript file, simply specify the <tt>.diskscript</tt> file as the source image
            instead of a regular image file. <i>a8rawconv</i> will then compile the script and either
            report any errors or run the script. The generated flux image is then treated as any other
            source for conversion or writing to physical disk.
        </p>

        <h3>Basic structure</h3>
        <p>
            DiskScript is modeled after the basic syntax of the C programming language, although with
            a much simpler structure. Statements are ended by a semicolon (<tt>;</tt>), and grouped as a block
            statement with curly braces (<tt>{}</tt>). Indentation is not significant and any amount
            of whitespace is the same as a single space. Comments may be single line with <tt>//</tt>
            or multi-line with <tt>/*</tt> and <tt>*/</tt>. Hexadecimal constants are prefixed with
            <tt>0x</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A disk script is generally structured as a series of tracks, with a list of commands to
            generate the flux transitions for each track. While creating a track, a <i>cursor</i> is
            advanced to track the current time or angular position within the track. Statements that
            add to the track advance the cursor by some time and possibly emit flux transitions within
            that time.
        </p>
        <p>
            As DiskScript is oriented toward Atari disk formats, the standard emit statements are
            based around a 4us raw bit cell at 288 RPM, for an ideal capacity of about 3,255 data bytes per
            track. Flux can be written for other densities including MFM by using the low-level flux
            commands, but the higher-level commands like <tt>byte</tt> use Atari FM timing. The generated
            flux stream uses 25ns precision for timing, same as the SuperCard Pro.
        </p>

        <h3>Statements</h3>
        <h4><tt>byte <i>value</i>;</tt></h4>
        <p>
            Emits flux transitions for an FM data byte with the specified value. The current position is
            assumed to be the center of the bit cell, so the first clock transition is written out after
            a delay of half a bit cell (2us), followed by the data transition another 4us later for
            a '1', or the next clock transition 8us later for a '0'. Eight pairs of clock and data cells
            are written and the cursor is advanced to the end of the last data bit cell (2us past last
            possible data transition for the last bit). Thus, the cursor is advanced by a total of 64us.
        </p>

        <h4><tt>bytes <i>value</i> [, <i>value</i>...];</tt></h4>
        <p>
            Writes one or more byte values from a comma-delimited list. This is just a shortcut for
            multiple bytes and is equivalent
            to emitting each byte out with a separate <tt>byte</tt> statement. The cursor is advanced
            by N*64us where N is the number of bytes in the list.
        </p>

        <h4><tt>crc_begin;</tt></h4>
        <p>
            Emits nothing, but marks the beginning of a region tracked for CRC-16 computation.
            Bytes emitted after this statement are included in the CRC up until the next <tt>crc_end</tt>
            statement, which ends the CRC computation and writes out the 16-bit CRC value.
        </p>
        <p>
            When writing an FDC-compatible address or data field in FM, the CRC scope should include the
            DAM/IDAM and the address or data field payload. For MFM, the leading three <tt>$A1</tt> sync
            bytes should also be included.
        </p>

        <h4><tt>crc_end;</tt></h4>
        <p>
            Writes the current CRC-16 value as two bytes, in big-endian order compatible with
            177x/277x FDCs. The cursor is advanced by two byte times (128us).
        </p>

        <h4><tt>flux <i>delay</i>;</tt></h4>
        <p>
            Emits a flux transition after the specified delay. The delay is specified in FM bit cell
            units, so a value of <tt>100</tt> means a delay of 4us. Two <tt>flux 100;</tt> statements
            therefore write out the clock and data cells for a FM '1' bit.
        </p>

        <h4><tt>no_flux <i>delay</i>;</tt></h4>
        <p>
            Advances the cursor by the given percentage of FM bit cells without emitting any flux
            transitions. A value of 100 advances the cursor by 4us.
        </p>

        <h4><tt>pad_bits <i>count</i>, <i>bit-value</i>;</tt></h4>
        <p>
            Emits zero or more FM data bits with the given value, either 0 or 1 for a 0/1 bit. This
            emits both a 4us clock cell and a 4us data cell, with a clock transition after 2us and
            a possible data transition after 6us. The cursor is advanced by 8us.
        </p>

        <h4><tt>repeat <i>count</i> <i>child-statement</i>;</tt></h4>
        <p>
            Repeats a child statement the given number of times. The child statement may be a single
            statement or a block of statements grouped by curly braces:
        </p>
        <pre>repeat 10
    byte 0xFF;

repeat 10 {
    byte 0xFF;
    byte 0x00;
}</pre>

        <h4><tt>special_byte <i>value</i>;</tt></h4>
        <p>
            Emits an FM byte with special clock transitions appropriate for an address or data mark,
            <tt>0xC7</tt>. Eight pairs of clock and data cells are written with the first clock transition
            2us after the starting position and the cursor is advanced by 64us. The byte value is
            usually either <tt>0xFE</tt> for an ID address mark (IDAM) or <tt>0xFB</tt> for a normal
            data address mark (DAM).
        </p>

        <h4><tt>track <i>track-number</i> [, <i>side-number</i>] <i>child-statement;</i></tt></h4>
        <p>
            Creates a track with the given track number from 0-82, with the child statement creating
            the contents of the track. All statements that emit flux or advance the cursor must be
            within a track statement. The child statement is typically a block of statements:
        </p>
        <pre>track 0 {
    // write address field
    byte 0x00;
    crc_begin;
    special_byte 0xFE;
    bytes 0x02, 0x20, 0x09, 0x00;
    crc_end;

    repeat 15 {
            byte 0x00;
    }

    // write data field
    crc_begin;
    special_byte 0xFB;
    repeat 128 {
            byte 0xFF;
    }
    crc_end;
}</pre>
        <p>
            If <i>side</i> is specified, then it should be either 0 (bottom) or 1 (top). If omitted, side 0
            is assumed.
        </p>

        <h4><tt>geometry <i>tracks</i>, <i>sides</i>;</tt></h4>
        <p>
            Sets the number of tracks per sides and sides in the disk geometry. For instance, <tt>geometry 40, 1;</tt>
            sets a 40-track, single-sided disk, while <tt>geometry 82, 2</tt> sets an 82-track, double-sided disk.
            This must be done before setting up tracks.
        </p>

                            The disk type for newly written images uses Other 720K instead of Atari FM if 96/135 TPI is used.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fixed a bug where the track number in the track header of SCP files was half of what it
                            should have been due to not counting track entries from the skipped side.
                        </li>

                            The SCP 1.6+ timestamp and footer are now written to the file.

                        <li>
                            The normalized flux timing flag is now set if the flux timing was synthesized from decoded data
                            rather than read from a physical disk.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Written images are now marked as using Index mode rather than Splice, to more closely match how
                            a8rawconv operates.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Extended header images are supported (flags bit 6 = 1).

                        <li>
                            Improved encoding heuristics to use better track splice points and improve tight track packing.

                            Interleave when encoding to flux or converting to ATX can now be controlled with the
                            <tt>-i</tt> option.

                    <li>
                        Fixed FDC status flags written into ATX images for long sectors. The CRC error bit is no longer always set and now reflects
                        the status as would be returned by a 1050, which reads the entire sector. The data request (DRQ) flag is also no longer
                        set. 810 emulators must override the flags by clearing the CRC error state and setting the lost data state.

                    <li>
                        Bits 2-7 of the sector address size field are now ignored as real FDCs do.

                    <li>
                        Fixed crash in macgcr decoder with empty tracks.

                <ul class="dense">
                    <li>Fixed issue causing drift in index mark times when decoding KryoFlux streams. This affected sector positions more noticeably with many revolutions.</li>
                    <li>Improved track splice logic when writing tracks to physical disks.</li>

                    <li>Fixed incorrect ATR header for enhanced density disks.</li>
                    <li>Fixed auto decoder selection to choose GCR decoder for Apple II disk formats.</li>
                    <li>Tweaked Apple II GCR decoder.</li>
                    <li>Added distance restrictions to IDAM/DAM matching to handle IDAM/IDAM/DAM/DAM pattern from interleaved sectors, since
                        real FDCs will reject a DAM that is too close or too far away from the IDAM.
                    </li>
                    <li>ATX writer now warns if the disk being encoded is a medium/enhanced or double density disk, which cannot be encoded in ATX.</li>
                    <li>Fixed encoding of ATX sector flag bits 5 and 6, which was incorrectly using 810-style signaling; bit 6
                        is now written properly as an extended data indicator and bit 5 alone reports the DAM.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added <tt>-tpi</tt> switch to read KryoFlux raw stream sets created with a 48 TPI drive.</li>
                    <li>Added <tt>-I</tt> switch for easier checking of Apple II text data, which has the high bit set by default.</li>
